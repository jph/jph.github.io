I made a Steambox, and thought I'd publish the helper scripts I put together for the DS4 controller I use. There exists a project called [ds4drv], which is a very nice implementation of the DS4 API for Linux machines.

This software is very easy to use, although it needs to be run as root, presumably to add a device to `/dev/input`:

{% highlight bash %}
~# ds4drv --emulate-xpad --led ff0000 --trackpad-mouse --battery-flash --hidraw
{% endhighlight %}

At this point, this is only working over USB. I've been having some problems with a cheap BT dongle. But the device appears (the input device named event16, the X-Box 360 Pad):

{% highlight bash %}
~$ evtest
...
Available devices:
/dev/input/event14: Sony Computer Entertainment Wireless Controller
/dev/input/event16: Microsoft X-Box 360 pad
{% endhighlight %}

The problem is that when both Big Picture and other XInput-compatible games enumerate the `/dev/input` devices looking for a controller, they all see the *Sony Computer Entertainment Wireless Controller* first. While this is easily fixed, I don't want to have to shell into my streaming machine every time I boot it.

{% highlight bash %}
~$ sudo chmod 400 /dev/input/event14
~$ evtest
...
Available devices:
/dev/input/event16: Microsoft X-Box 360 pad
{% endhighlight %}

Now, Big Picture and my other games will correctly bind to the XInput device.

And, to automate this, I've put together an upstart script. This will perform all of the above when the machine boots, provided the controller is plugged in.

{% highlight bash %}
description "ds4-helper"
start on startup

pre-start script
  chmod 400 /dev/input/by-id/usb-Sony_Computer_Entertainment_Wireless_Controller-event-joystick
end script

exec ds4drv --emulate-xpad --led ff0000 --trackpad-mouse --battery-flash --hidraw
{% endhighlight %}
